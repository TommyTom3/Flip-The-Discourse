        I’m Tom Hafner. I’m interested in how complex systems regulate — and how they fail.
        <strong>Flip The Discourse</strong> is an attempt to examine tension, attention, regulation,
        and reciprocal exchange with both scientific discipline and lived honesty.
      </p>

      <p>
        For many years, my personal system was far from regulated.
        That dysregulation affected not only myself, but those around me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recovery required attention — attention to the tension I would have rather ignored.
        It required regulation — a sustained effort in a tense world.
        It required metacognition — admitting faults and questioning beliefs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, that awareness expanded my agency, which had previously been constrained.
        Agency expanded my range of choices.
        Those choices changed the direction of my life.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am still learning, and I intend to continue learning through this project.
        My hope is that this work becomes a thoughtful and enduring resource —
        not only for myself, but for others navigating similar terrain.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are living in a moment where public exchange is often rigid and reactive.
        This project explores whether regulated awareness can scale —
        from the individual to institutions —
        toward more reciprocal exchange and greater stability.
      </p>

      <p>
        When regulation weakens at scale within individuals, the capacity 
        for societal self-governance weakens as well.  
      </p>

        <h1 class="h1">Background</h1>

          <p>
          I've worked within many different systems —
          physical, regulated, and educational. Those environments
          shaped how I think about attention, regulation, and agency.

          or just want to discuss the issues I write about:
