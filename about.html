                I’m Tom Hafner. I’m interested in how complex systems regulate — and how they fail.
                Flip The Discourse is an attempt to examine attention, metacognition, and dialogue
                with both scientific discipline and lived honesty.
              </p>

              <p>
                For many years, my personal system was far from regulated. That dysregulation
                affected not only myself, but those around me.
              </p>

              <p>
                There were many factors that contributed to my sobriety, but each required
                metacognition — the ability to think about my own thinking – “stinkin’ thinkin’.”
              </p>

              <p>
                I am still learning, and I intend to continue learning through this project.
              </p>

              <p>
                My hope is that this work becomes a thoughtful and enduring resource —
                not only for myself, but for others navigating similar terrain.
                We are living in a moment where public discourse is often polemic.
                This project explores whether we can <em>Flip That Discourse</em> toward something more civil.
