        <p class="subtitle"><em>On Attention, Metacognition, and the Softening of Tension</em></p>

        <p class="byline">Thomas J. Hafner · February 2026</p>

        <p>There is tension amongst many of us, and tension within many of us.</p>

        <p>This is tied to how we relate to one another, and to how we relate to our own consciousness.</p>

        <p>It is tied to how we relate to information–and how we exchange it.</p>

        <p>All relationships are built upon the exchange of information: communication.</p>

        <p>If we are to ease the tension within or among us, we must examine how we communicate.</p>

        <p>And that requires us to think about our thinking.</p>

        <p>How do we communicate with one another?<br>
        How do we communicate to ourselves?</p>

        <p>What is the quality of our listening–to others, and to our own bodies and minds?</p>

        <p>Is there a way to ease tension?</p>

        <p>I believe that there is.</p>

        <p>Through calm, intentional, and non-judgmental engagement with our own minds, we can begin to examine how we speak to ourselves internally and how we listen to the signals our bodies provide. By closely examining this internal exchange of information, we expand our awareness of the complex system we inhabit.</p>

        <p>As awareness grows, patterns emerge. We begin to recognize the habitual styles of our thinking and the points where tension accumulates. With this recognition comes choice. If we can see the patterns clearly, we can begin to reshape them. We can change the way we speak to ourselves.</p>

        <p>If that were not possible, I would not be sober.</p>

        <p>When we learn to focus attention, we enable metacognition. We question the source of our thoughts. We shift from autopilot to manual control. In doing so, we regain agency in our lives. Meaning and purpose begin to emerge, and while the tension of life does not disappear, it softens.</p>

        <p>I believe these same principles have relevance beyond the individual.</p>

        <p>Through calm, intentional, and non-judgmental engagement in civil discourse, we can begin to better understand one another and the complex social systems we share.</p>

        <p>Polemic discourse, by contrast, shuts down information channels. With less information, we perceive less of the system. When perception narrows, misunderstanding grows, and tension hardens.</p>

        <p>If information channels remain closed, how will we identify the tension points that lead to the breakdown of complex systems?</p>

        <p>How long can we remain in a state of unresolved tension?</p>

        <p><strong>Flipping the discourse from polemic to civil is not merely preferable–it is necessary.</strong></p>
