          <p>
            There is tension within many of us, and tension between many of us.
          </p>

          <p>
            When tension rises, perception narrows. When perception narrows, choice shrinks.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is tied to how we relate to information — and how we exchange it.
          </p>

          <p>
            All relationships are built on information exchange: communication.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we want to ease tension within or between us, we have to examine how we communicate.
            And that requires us to think about our thinking.
          </p>

          <p>
            How do we communicate with one another?<br>
            How do we communicate with ourselves?
          </p>

          <p>
            What is the quality of our listening — to others, and to our own bodies and minds?
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe there is a way to soften tension without denying reality or dehumanizing people.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through calm, intentional, and non-judgmental engagement with our own minds,
            we can begin to notice the tightening before reaction. We can observe what we attend to,
            what we avoid, and what stories we tell ourselves.
          </p>

          <p>
            As awareness grows, patterns emerge. With recognition comes choice.
            If we can see the pattern clearly, we can begin to reshape it.
          </p>

          <p>
            If that were not possible, I would not be sober.
          </p>

          <p>
            When we learn to direct attention, we enable metacognition.
            We shift from autopilot to manual control. In doing so, we regain agency.
            The tension of life does not disappear, but it can soften.
          </p>

          <div class="hr"></div>

          <p>
            I believe these same dynamics apply beyond the individual.
          </p>

          <p>
            Civil discourse is not softness. It is structure.
            Structure keeps information channels open long enough for correction to occur.
          </p>

          <p>
            Polemic discourse, by contrast, closes information channels.
            With less information, we perceive less of the system.
            When perception narrows, misunderstanding grows and tension hardens.
          </p>

          <p>
            If information channels remain closed, we cannot identify the tension points that lead
            to breakdown — in relationships, in communities, or in institutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Flipping the discourse from polemic to civil is not merely preferable — it is necessary.
            </strong>
