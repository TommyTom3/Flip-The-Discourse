            <p>
                Very few of us wake up intending to cause harm. Yet we see increasing tension within individuals and across institutions.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                Part of this tension reflects genuine differences. We hold different values. We prioritize different time horizons.
                We tolerate different levels of risk. We place varying degrees of trust in institutions. We define “harm” and “care”
                in different ways. These differences are not signs of moral failure. They are features of complex human systems.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                Yet beneath these tensions lies something shared: vulnerability. We are finite, uncertain beings navigating complex
                systems we only partially understand. Compassion for the human condition does not require agreement. It requires
                recognizing that most people are attempting to protect something they value. This project proceeds from that assumption.
