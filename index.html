              <p>
                Flip The Discourse (FTD) is a calm platform dedicated to disciplined civil discourse,
                epistemic humility, and the reduction of human suffering.
              </p>

              <p>
                We believe most people want to help others.
                We often disagree not because we are enemies,
                but because we weigh risk differently,
                interpret evidence differently,
                and prioritize different values.
              </p>

              <p>
                FTD exists to slow reaction,
                separate data from assumption,
                and create a space where disagreement can occur without dehumanization.
              </p>

                <h3>Under Construction</h3>

                <p>
                  This platform is being built slowly and intentionally.
                  Topics will be added gradually.
                  Essays and videos will expand over time.
                </p>

                 <p class="small">
                  Built slow. Built careful. Built for clarity.
                 </p>
