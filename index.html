    We live in a cave. Let’s examine the shadows — together.

  <p>
    Flip The Discourse (FTD) is a calm platform dedicated to disciplined civil discourse,
    epistemic humility, and the reduction of human suffering.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe most people want to help others.
    We often disagree not because we are enemies,
    but because we weigh risk differently,
    interpret evidence differently,
    and prioritize different values.
  </p>

  <p>
    FTD exists to slow reaction,
    separate data from assumption,
    and create a space where disagreement can occur without dehumanization.

  <h3>Under Construction</h3>

  <p>
    This platform is being built slowly and intentionally.

    Built slow. Built careful. Built for clarity.
